#TODO
    # Program in diagonals for additional lines
        # When user puts only 1 or 2 lines, all 3 lists should be diplayed still
        # up to 5 lines possible
    # I am happy with the version of the build. No major bugs. Do not think I am learning much more from this project.
        # Maybe in future I will come back to this and add the extra lines. I need to working on another project.
    # The only thing I can work on now is ensuring the odds are fair. I will write data to file and analyse it

    #Work out better odds for game, I want the player to eventually lose

    # Allow specify chance of a particular symbol #A: Done
        #For example X should have lower chance to show
    # Make player bar scale #A: DONE
        # Read how many total characters for 'credit' 'betAmount' 'previous win' and print more '__'
    # Add more ASCII art

    # A : Can we modularise counting previous win totals and credit won into their own seperate functions
        # This would allow for easier debugging and readability
#BUG
    # I found a bug, could still bet under 0 credits. This occurrred because although it was checking enough credits, it was not checking for the * lines
