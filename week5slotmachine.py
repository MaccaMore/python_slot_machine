    #Work out better odds for game, I want the player to eventually lose

    # Allow specify chance of a particular symbol #A: Done
        #For example X should have lower chance to show

        # Read how many total characters for 'credit' 'betAmount' 'previous win' and print more '__'
    # Add more ASCII art

    # A : Can we modularise counting previous win totals and credit won into their own seperate functions
